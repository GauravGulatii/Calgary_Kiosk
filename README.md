### Functionality Notes
As a prototype some functionality was not fully integrated, below is how to use existing functionality:
- The only languages working at this stage are English and Korean. So to see a different language view got to `language page` select `Korean` and press `Confirm`.
- QR scanning was implemented for the `Points of Interest`, `Plan a Trip`, and `Fare Information` pages to scan the `Points of Interest` and `Plan a Trip` pages simply select a destination.
- The rest of the functionality should be straightforward to use as it is all static data and the components are clickable.
